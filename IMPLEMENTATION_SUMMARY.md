## 🎨 ZUPCO Design Principles Applied

7. **Avatars**: Circular, fun, colorful gradient backgrounds
8. **Badges**: Rounded, color-coded (blue for students, orange for tutors, green for active)

4. **Unique Emails**: Each tutor must have a unique email address
5. **Optional Assignment**: Students can exist without an assigned tutor

- **Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation for capacity limits
- **Responsive Design**: All new components are fully responsive
